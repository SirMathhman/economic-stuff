The purpose of this project is to examine potential [relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econophysics) between the economic world and the physics world. However,
this project aims to give equivalence from many of the more complex physical phenomena, e.g. general relativity and quantum mechanics, and relay those upon the economic systems.
It is reasonable to claim that the analysis of the economy in this context may show insights with regards to how some of these bodies of physics may be interpreted thereuponafter.
