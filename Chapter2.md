# Derivations

We start by explaining the conversation of mass and energy.
Many of the laws of physics completely rely upon the ideas of mass and energy, and it would nopt be wise to claim further that such physical laws apply without constructing the notion of mass and energy in an economic sense.

Do recall that, according to Einstein, mass and energy and equivalent things, through `E = mc^2`. However, this was made with the assumption of special relativity holding true, where he [postulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) the following:

- The laws of physics are invariant (identical) in all inertial frames of reference (that is, frames of reference with no acceleration).
- The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of light source or observer.

First we define a frame of reference in an economic context. Do recall that, for all particles in physical systems, there exists a frame of reference for each particle, and that reality may be centered around that frame.
