# Chapter 2: Derivations

We start by explaining the conversation of mass and energy.
Many of the laws of physics completely rely upon the ideas of mass and energy, and it would nopt be wise to claim further that such physical laws apply without constructing the notion of mass and energy in an economic sense.

Do recall that, according to Einstein, mass and energy and equivalent things, through `E = mc^2`. However, this was made with the assumption of special relativity holding true, where he [postulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) the following:

- The laws of physics are invariant (identical) in all inertial frames of reference (that is, frames of reference with no acceleration).
- The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of light source or observer.

First we define a frame of reference in an economic context. Do recall that, for all particles in physical systems, there exists a frame of reference for each particle, and that reality may be centered around that frame.

Likewise, it seems reasonable to claim that for all agents within an economy, there exists a frame of reference in which the economy may be framed. For example, take the relations between two economies -- one developed (the United States of America) and one developing (the Kingdom of Cambodia).
The economy of the United States is overwhelmingly stronger than Cambodia's, and due to this, different economic laws and theories apply to the United States to which Cambodia does not have to adhere. For instance, the U.S. dollar is the reserve currency for many nations around the world, whereas the Cambodian riel is not used (at all?).

However, the ideas of supply, demand, inflation, deflation, regulation, etc. appear to apply to all countries, regardless of political ideology or culture, it seems to reasonable to claim that the laws of economics apply in all frames of reference and are thus invariant.
Economic laws apply the same in democratic countries such as Norway to authoritarian countries such as Turkmenistan. 

In fact, there may exist some schools of thought that state that a country's political thought is a result (similar to geographical determinism) of economic pressures.
An example of this would be the collapse of the Soviet Union, where it could claimed that due to the state investing primarily in the military and space, the lack of investment into other sectors of the economy ultimately led to state collapse. Because the collapse of the Soviet Union was mostly peaceful, it can be claimed that the country imploded due to economic forces, and not due to outside pressures such as military.
