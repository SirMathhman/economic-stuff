# Chapter 2: Derivations

We start by explaining the conversation of mass and energy.
Many of the laws of physics completely rely upon the ideas of mass and energy, and it would nopt be wise to claim further that such physical laws apply without constructing the notion of mass and energy in an economic sense.

We later prove that mass and energy are equivalent through special relativity (and in theory special relativity should henceforth apply). However we first describe the manner by which the conservation of energy (and thus mass) are defined in an economic context. The conversation of energy, in physics, states that the total energy within an isolated system remains constant. In the current global economy, that isolated system is the Earth itself (as of right now).

We start by challenging the fundamental assumption that value is produced. We assert that value is not produced, but transformed.

Let us give an example. Glass is a useful substance with numerous applications. Glass, for the most part, is made of silica, which comes from sand, however do note that not all sand can be used to make glass.

We start at the current economic interpretation of firms producing glass. The idea is that firms create value (which is then subsequently materialized as profit) through the production of glass, where the inventory (physical capital) of the firm is the silica and other materials used to make glass.

Nonetheless, let us state that the glass has the **potential** value to make glass, and it through production that the value is transformed into a different type. This does indeed apply in physics, where different types of energy, such as chemical to mechanical, changes. Therefore, the glass had innate value within it that was realized when it became glass, yet it was also always there.

Consequently, even thought it can be claimed that the firm produced value from the glass, the situation may be reframed as firm reducing potential value within the silica to produce glass, where a portion of that becomes the value created by the firm and a portion of that value remains within the glass. In theory, this makes sense -- the number of applications that silica, and its derivatives have, is greater than the number of applications that glass, and its derivatives have. This is due to the fact the production process of transforming silica to glass restricts other derivatives of silica to becoming glass. This might explain phenomena regarding the profitability of firms, but we leave that as an exercise to the reader.

Because of this reframing of ideas, we can actually state that, within the closed economic system, the total value (energy) is preserved. This means that the idea of the Earth having a upper limit of how much economic value can be produced.

It may be argued that, through technology, the upper limit increases. The idea being that, due to advances in technology, the innate potential value within substances increase, e.g. the printing press increased the value of wood. However, it must be noted that an economy is also a physical system, and thus is still constrained to using the actual laws of physics, e.g. of conversation of mass and energy.

Therefore, the constraints placed upon us by physics should, in theory (unless our understanding of fundamental physical laws change), still apply the economy. There should be a maximum amount of usage and production of an environment, regardless of how technology advanced a civilization may become. In fact, it is more often than not that technological growth forces a cilization to break free from the initial closed economic system, e.g. from a continental society to a global society, or from a planetary society to a interplanetary one.

## Mass - Energy Equivalence

Do recall that, according to Einstein, mass and energy and equivalent things, through `E = mc^2`. However, this was made with the assumption of special relativity holding true, where he [postulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) the following:

- The laws of physics are invariant (identical) in all inertial frames of reference (that is, frames of reference with no acceleration).
- The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of light source or observer.

### Frames of Reference

First we define a frame of reference in an economic context. Do recall that, for all particles in physical systems, there exists a frame of reference for each particle, and that reality may be centered around that frame.

Likewise, it seems reasonable to claim that for all agents within an economy, there exists a frame of reference in which the economy may be framed. For example, take the relations between two economies -- one developed (the United States of America) and one developing (the Kingdom of Cambodia).
The economy of the United States is overwhelmingly stronger than Cambodia's, and due to this, different economic laws and theories apply to the United States to which Cambodia does not have to adhere. For instance, the U.S. dollar is the reserve currency for many nations around the world, whereas the Cambodian riel is not used (at all?).

However, the ideas of supply, demand, inflation, deflation, regulation, etc. appear to apply to all countries, regardless of political ideology or culture, it seems to reasonable to claim that the laws of economics apply in all frames of reference and are thus invariant.
Economic laws apply the same in democratic countries such as Norway to authoritarian countries such as Turkmenistan.

In fact, there may exist some schools of thought that state that a country's political thought is a result (similar to geographical determinism) of economic pressures.
An example of this would be the collapse of the Soviet Union, where it could claimed that due to the state investing primarily in the military and space, the lack of investment into other sectors of the economy ultimately led to state collapse. Because the collapse of the Soviet Union was mostly peaceful, it can be claimed that the country imploded due to economic forces, and not due to outside pressures such as military.

### The Speed of Light?

At first impression, the concept of the speed of light does not apply to an economy. Why should there be a cosmic speed limit?

However, it is reasonable to claim that there is a limit, both in terms of theoretic as well as practical with regards to how fast firms can grow. This limit would unsurprisingly be dependent on the environment in which the economy takes place. This also produces an interesting discussion of the origin of the speed of light, but that's a story for another time.

Regardless of the value of this speed limit, we need to look at the visible effects caused by approaching this speed limit. In special relativity, approaching the speed of light causes the time within the moving reference frame to [slow down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation). Furthermore, it is also asserted that the [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction) of a moving object decreases when approaching the speed of light.

Recall that our interpretation of velocity is the change in position, both in physics as well as economics. Thus, our interpretation of time dilation should be that economics and firms that are rapidly changing their competitive standing (position) should also have a slower internal clock.
