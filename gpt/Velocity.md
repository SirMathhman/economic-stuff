# Velocity

The concept of velocity, with a physics interpretation, can be interpreted in an economic context by using it as an analogy for a company's rate of change in performance or financial metrics over time.

In physics, velocity is defined as the rate of change of an object's position with respect to time. In economics, we can use the same concept to describe a company's rate of change in performance or financial metrics over time, such as revenue growth or earnings growth. This is often referred to as the company's "velocity of growth."

The velocity of growth can be measured over different time periods, such as quarterly or annually, and can provide insights into the company's performance trends. A high velocity of growth indicates that the company is growing at a rapid pace, while a low velocity of growth indicates that the company's growth rate is slower.
